# Continuous Integration as Code

### Idea 

The idea of this repository is show how you can configure/setup pipelines (continues integration) for your projects using GitLab CI.
In this example we will use ReactJS for frontend application and NodeJS/Express for backend. So for artifacts we will use Docker to create images.
