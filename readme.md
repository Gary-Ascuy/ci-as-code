# Continuous Integration as Code

### Idea

The idea of this repository is show how you can configure/setup pipelines (continues integration) for your projects using GitLab CI.
In this example we will use ReactJS for frontend application and NodeJS/Express for backend. So for artifacts we will use Docker to create images.

### How can I run?

Update the following file with the values.

```sh
cat .env
```

Run using docker compose, you have `build`, `push`, `up` operations.

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```
